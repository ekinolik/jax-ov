# Cursor Rules for jax-ov Project

## CHANGELOG Updates

When making any code changes or updates to this project:

1. Check the `.version` file to get the current version number
2. Increment the version number internally by 1 (do NOT modify the .version file itself)
3. Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` with:
   - The incremented version number in brackets (e.g., `[1.0.00002]`)
   - Today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - A brief, simple description of what changed under appropriate section (Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed)

Example format:
```markdown
## [1.0.00002] - 2025-12-06

### Changed
- Brief description of the change
```

Keep changelog entries concise and focused on what changed, not implementation details.
