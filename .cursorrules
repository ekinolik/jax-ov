# Cursor Rules for jax-ov Project

## CHANGELOG Updates

When making any code changes or updates to this project:

1. Read the current version from the `.version` file
2. **IMPORTANT**: Increment the version number by 1 FIRST (do NOT modify the .version file itself)
3. Use the INCREMENTED version number (not the current one) in the CHANGELOG entry
4. Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` with:
   - The INCREMENTED version number in brackets (e.g., if .version is `1.0.00003`, use `[1.0.00004]`)
   - Today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - A brief, simple description of what changed under appropriate section (Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed)

Example:
- Current version in `.version`: `1.0.00003`
- Increment to: `1.0.00004`
- CHANGELOG entry: `## [1.0.00004] - 2025-12-06`

Example format:
```markdown
## [1.0.00004] - 2025-12-06

### Changed
- Brief description of the change
```

Keep changelog entries concise and focused on what changed, not implementation details.

## Build Output Directory

When testing builds with `go build`, always use the `builds/` directory as the output directory instead of the root directory. This keeps the root directory clean and avoids needing to add new binaries to `.gitignore`.

Example:
```bash
go build -o builds/test-command ./cmd/test-command
```

Never build binaries directly to the root directory during development or testing.
